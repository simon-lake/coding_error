# coding_error
abstract class error

a general background to my code

i am converting csv files to elsx
i then create numerous workbooks for each relationship i do
I then merge all workbooks into one while creating multiple sheets within.

this seems to run fine

i then conduct analysis for each relationship
i create a scatterplot filtering out certain values and the calculate the R2 and equation of the linear regression
the code appears to run fine giving no errors

firstly when i run the debug i get the following error message:
Abstract class 'ExcelWriter' with abstract methods instantiated (Ln 244)

I cant seem it figure out what this means

the other problem i get is the plots R2 values are different compared to when i calculate manually in excel. the equations are the same though.

I will attached my full code if someone can please help me
